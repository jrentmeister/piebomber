            <h2>THE PIEBOMBER MISSION</h2>
            <p>
              PieBomber was founded with a simple mission: to deliver explosive flavor to
              communities through handcrafted pies made with premium ingredients and
              nostalgic recipes. What started as a passion project has become a full-scale
              operation, deploying our mobile kitchen to neighborhoods across the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe great food brings people together. Whether it's a wood-fired pizza
              pie, a savory pot pie, or a classic dessert, each creation is crafted with
              precision and care. Our commitment to quality and community drives everything we do.

                  The idea was born: bring chef-quality pies directly to the people.
                  After months of recipe testing and retrofitting a vintage food truck,
                  PieBomber was ready for deployment.
